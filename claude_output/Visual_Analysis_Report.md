## VISUALIZATION 1: Q1 WAREHOUSE OPERATIONS

**File:** `Q1_Warehouse_Operations_Analysis.png`

### Panel 1: Volume Growth vs. Processing Time
- Orders: 12,500 → 16,300 (+30%)
- Processing Time: 19.5 → 23.7 min (+22%)
- **Finding:** Losing efficiency as we scale - processing time should decrease with volume, not increase

### Panel 2: Quality Crisis
- Picking Errors: 62 → 128 (+106%)
- Late Deliveries: 43 → 67 (+56%)
- **Finding:** Quality deteriorating 3.5x faster than volume growth

### Panel 3: Workforce Burnout
- Overtime: 120 → 220 hours (+83%)
- Absences: 7 → 18 days (+157%)
- **Finding:** Clear burnout signals - absenteeism growing 5x faster than volume

### Panel 4: Efficiency Metrics (Normalized)
- Errors per 1K orders: 4.96 → 7.85 (+58%)
- Late per 1K orders: 3.44 → 4.11 (+19%)
- **Finding:** Quality declining independent of volume - systemic issue

### Panel 5: Growth Rate Comparison
Visual comparison of all metrics against 30% volume baseline
- **Finding:** Every problem metric growing faster than revenue

### Key Takeaway
Operations are breaking under growth pressure. Need immediate stabilization before adding complexity.

## VISUALIZATION 2: LARGE ORDERS (5+ ITEMS) CRISIS

**File:** `Large_Orders_Crisis_Analysis.png`

### Panel 1: Large Order Volume
- 1,250 → 1,700 orders (+36%)
- **Finding:** Growing faster than overall volume

### Panel 2: Picking Errors on Large Orders
- 22 → 54 errors (+145%)
- **Finding:** Worst metric in entire dataset

### Panel 3: Error Rate
- 1.76% → 3.18% (+81%)
- **Finding:** Breached critical threshold (3%) - catastrophic level

### Panel 4: Large Orders as % of Total
- Stable at ~10% of volume
- **Finding:** Not a mix shift issue - operational failure

### Panel 5: Error Concentration Analysis
- Large orders = 10.4% of volume
- But cause = 42.2% of all errors
- **Finding:** 4x error concentration - the smoking gun

### Key Takeaway
Large orders are the primary driver of the quality crisis. Fix the 10% to solve 42% of errors.
