# Case Study 2: Prioritization & Decision-Making

## Context
Monday morning with 5 competing issues in the queue, informed by Q1 analysis showing:
- Picking errors up 106.5%
- Late deliveries up 55.8%
- Staff absences up 157%
- Large order error rate at 3.18%

---

## Priority Ranking (1 = Most Urgent)

### **#1 - Major Client: 15 Late Deliveries Last Week**

**Rationale:**
- **Immediate revenue risk** - Could lose major client just after onboarding
- **Contractual implications** - Potential SLA breaches and penalties
- **Time sensitivity** - Already escalating, requires immediate damage control
- **Q1 context** - System-wide late deliveries already up 55.8%; this client experiencing our systemic failures

**Impact:** Existential threat to business relationship and revenue

---

### **#2 - Picking System: 10% Error Rate (Orders >5 Items)**

**Rationale:**
- **Root cause of client issues** - Systemic problem driving late deliveries
- **Affects multiple clients daily** - Not isolated to one relationship
- **Q1 context** - Our analysis shows 3.18% error rate in March; 10% is even worse
- **Strategic priority** - Fix the foundation vs firefighting symptoms

**Impact:** Quality crisis affecting entire client base

---

### **#3 - Spike in Warehouse Staff Absenteeism**

**Rationale:**
- **Leading indicator** - Burnout signal that precedes retention crisis
- **Root cause contributor** - Directly impacts errors and delays
- **Q1 context** - Absences up 157% (7→18 days), workforce under severe strain
- **Cascading risk** - If staff quit, all other problems worsen exponentially

**Impact:** Foundation of operational capacity at risk

---

### **#4 - Manager Report: Overtime Impact on Error Rates**

**Rationale:**
- **Strategic analysis** - Important for capacity planning, not crisis response
- **Q1 context** - Data already shows correlation (overtime +83%, errors +106%)
- **Internal stakeholder** - Manager request can be scheduled
- **Lower urgency** - Informs future decisions, doesn't resolve current crisis

**Impact:** Planning input, not operational emergency

---

### **#5 - IT Input: Barcode Scanner Test Plan**

**Rationale:**
- **Future improvement** - Scheduled technology upgrade, not urgent fix
- **No blocking dependency** - IT can proceed without immediate input
- **Q1 context** - Technology won't solve process and capacity issues
- **Long-term benefit** - Efficiency gain but current scanners are functional

**Impact:** Incremental improvement, not crisis resolution

## Top Priority Action Plan

### **Issue: Major Client - 15 Late Deliveries Last Week**

#### **Action 1: Immediate Client Engagement (0-2 hours)**

**What:**
1. Schedule call with client within 24 hours
2. Pull detailed data on all 15 late deliveries:
   - Order dates and expected delivery dates
   - Root cause for each delay (picking error, capacity, staffing)
   - Current status and resolution timeline
3. Prepare accountability statement + recovery plan
4. Determine appropriate compensation if warranted

**Why First:**
- Demonstrates responsiveness and seriousness
- Gathers facts before making promises
- Prevents further relationship deterioration
- Shows operational rigor through data-driven approach

---

#### **Action 2: Root Cause Analysis (2-6 hours)**

**What:**
1. Assemble cross-functional team (operations, logistics, quality)
2. Map delays across entire process: receiving → picking → packing → shipping
3. Analyze for patterns:
   - Same picker or shift involved?
   - Specific product categories or order complexity?
   - Order size correlation (likely >5 items based on Q1 data)
4. Interview warehouse staff involved in the delays
5. Correlate delays with:
   - Overtime periods (capacity strain)
   - Absenteeism spikes (staffing gaps)
   - Date/time patterns

**Why Second:**
- Can't implement lasting fix without understanding root cause
- Prevents treating symptoms instead of disease
- May reveal this is manifestation of systemic issues from Q1 analysis
- Data determines if solution is process, people, or technology

**Expected Finding:** Given Q1 data, likely related to large order picking errors (3.18% rate) and capacity constraints.

---

#### **Action 3: Implement Containment Measures (Days 2-3)**

**What - Scenario-Based Response:**

**If Root Cause = Picking Errors (Most Likely):**
- Implement mandatory double-check for this client's orders
- Assign most experienced pickers to their orders
- Add QC checkpoint before shipment
- Real-time photo verification at packing

**If Root Cause = Capacity/Timing:**
- Flag this client's orders for priority pick sequence
- Create real-time alerts when orders enter system
- Adjust cut-off times for guaranteed delivery

**If Root Cause = Staffing Gaps:**
- Ensure adequate coverage during their typical order windows
- Cross-train backup staff specifically for this client
- Pre-allocate overtime if needed during their peak periods

**Universal Measures:**
- Create daily tracking dashboard specifically for this client
- Assign single point of contact to monitor all their orders
- Daily check-ins with client contact during stabilization period

**Why Third:**
- Buys time while systemic issues are addressed
- Demonstrates concrete action to client
- Reduces risk of additional failures during fix implementation
- Provides data on intervention effectiveness

**Success Metrics:**
- Zero late deliveries for this client in next 2 weeks
- <1% picking error rate on their orders
- Client satisfaction score improvement

## Prioritization Framework Used

**Impact-Urgency Matrix:**
- **High Impact + High Urgency** = Do First (#1)
- **High Impact + Medium Urgency** = Do Second (#2)
- **Medium Impact + Medium Urgency** = Do Third (#3)
- **Medium Impact + Low Urgency** = Schedule (#4)
- **Low Impact + Low Urgency** = Defer (#5)

**Decision Principle:**
Client relationships and revenue preservation take precedence, followed by systemic quality issues, then root causes, then strategic analysis, finally future improvements.
