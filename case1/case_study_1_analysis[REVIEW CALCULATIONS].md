# Case Study 1: Q1 Operations Performance Review

---

## Slide 1: Key Performance Trends

### Trend 1: Error Rates Outpacing Volume Growth
- Order volume increased **30%** (12.5K → 16.3K orders)
- Picking errors increased **106%** (62 → 128 errors)
- Large order (5+ items) error rate **doubled** from 1.76% to 3.18%

### Trend 2: Resource Strain Indicators
- Processing time increased **22%** (19.5 → 23.7 min/order)
- Overtime hours increased **83%** (120 → 220 hrs)
- Staff absences **tripled** (7 → 18 days)

**Critical insight:** Operations scaling issues - error rates and strain metrics growing 2-3x faster than order volume.

## Slide 3: COO Briefing - Operational Risks

### Main Findings
Q1 order volume increased 30%, but operational capacity has not scaled proportionally. Quality and efficiency metrics are deteriorating at 2-3x the rate of volume growth.

### Critical Risks
1. **Quality degradation** - Picking error rate doubled; large orders particularly affected (3.18% error rate by March)
2. **Capacity ceiling** - Staff showing clear strain (tripled absences, 83% more overtime, slower processing)
3. **Client satisfaction threat** - Late deliveries up 56%; major risk to new client retention

### Root Cause Hypothesis
Workforce training and systems not prepared for rapid 30% scale-up. Large orders revealing process bottlenecks.

## Slide 4: COO Briefing - Strategic Opportunities

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Process intervention** - Investigate large order picking workflow (error rate = 3.18%)
2. **Capacity planning** - Current trajectory unsustainable; evaluate staffing models
3. **Training refresh** - New client orders may have different profiles than existing

### Strategic Opportunities
- **Competitive moat** - Fix operations now to handle growth competitors can't
- **Premium positioning** - Solve large order complexity = differentiation for clients
- **Data-driven culture** - Use this as case study for predictive capacity planning

### Recommendation
Immediate task force on large order workflow redesign while conducting full capacity assessment for Q2 projections.
