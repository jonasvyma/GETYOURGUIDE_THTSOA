# SLIDE 4: CASE STUDY 1 (CONTINUED) - COO BRIEFING: THE PROBLEM

## Operations Quality Crisis

### Executive Summary
Q1's 30% volume growth has exposed critical capacity constraints. Quality and service metrics are deteriorating at 2-3x the rate of volume growth, signaling systemic issues rather than temporary growing pains.

### The Core Issue
Our warehouse operations were optimized for lower volumes and simpler orders. We're now experiencing a quality collapse, particularly on complex orders (>5 items), which now represent 10.4% of volume but 42% of all errors.

### Critical Metrics Snapshot
- **Picking Errors:** Growing 3.5x faster than volume
- **Large Order Error Rate:** Nearly doubled in 90 days
- **Staff Burnout:** Clear signals in absenteeism spike
- **Processing Efficiency:** Declining 17.6% despite experience curve

---

# SLIDE 5: CASE STUDY 1 (CONTINUED) - COO BRIEFING: RISKS & ACTIONS

## Immediate Risks

### 1. Client Churn Risk
- Major clients experiencing declining service levels
- 15 late deliveries reported last week by single major client
- SLA breaches may trigger contract penalties or termination

### 2. Financial Risk
- Overtime costs growing 2.7x faster than revenue
- Unsustainable margin compression
- Inefficiency costs accelerating

### 3. Operational Risk
- Picking system optimized for small orders, breaking on complex ones
- 10% error rate on orders >5 items is catastrophic
- Quality issues causing downstream delivery delays

### 4. Talent Risk
- Burnout trajectory unsustainable
- Staff retention threatened
- Training gaps evident as complexity increases

## Recommended Actions (Priority Order)

### Immediate (Week 1)
✓ Implement dedicated large-order picking workflow to stop quality hemorrhaging

### Short-term (Month 1)
✓ Strategic hiring plan to replace structural overtime with sustainable capacity

### Medium-term (Q2)
✓ Invest in picking technology/automation specifically for orders >5 items

**Bottom Line:** Invest now or risk losing the clients we just won. Current trajectory is unsustainable.

# SLIDE 6: CASE STUDY 2 - PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK

## Monday Morning Queue: 5 Competing Issues

### Priority Ranking & Rationale

**#1 - MOST URGENT: Major client - 15 late deliveries last week**
- **Why #1:** Immediate revenue risk, relationship in jeopardy, contractual implications
- **Impact:** Could lose major client (existential threat)
- **Time Sensitivity:** Already escalating - damage control mode

**#2 - Picking system 10% error rate (orders >5 items)**
- **Why #2:** Systemic problem causing late deliveries and client issues
- **Impact:** Affects multiple clients daily, quality foundation issue
- **Time Sensitivity:** Has time for proper solution vs immediate firefighting

**#3 - Spike in warehouse staff absenteeism**
- **Why #3:** Leading indicator of retention problems, driving errors and delays
- **Impact:** Root cause contributor to other issues
- **Time Sensitivity:** Can be addressed over 1-2 weeks

**#4 - Manager report: overtime impact on error rates**
- **Why #4:** Analytical request, important for planning but not crisis
- **Impact:** Informs future hiring vs overtime decisions
- **Time Sensitivity:** Can be scheduled, internal stakeholder only

**#5 - LEAST URGENT: IT input on barcode scanner test plan**
- **Why #5:** Future improvement, doesn't block IT timeline significantly
- **Impact:** Long-term efficiency, current scanners functional
- **Time Sensitivity:** Scheduled rollout, planned change

# SLIDE 7: CASE STUDY 2 (CONTINUED) - TOP PRIORITY ACTION PLAN

## Issue: Major Client - 15 Late Deliveries Last Week

### First Three Actions

#### ACTION 1: Immediate Client Engagement (First 2 Hours)
**What:**
- Schedule call with client within 24 hours
- Pull detailed data on all 15 late deliveries (dates, root causes, status)
- Prepare accountability statement + recovery plan
- Offer compensation if appropriate

**Why First:**
- Demonstrates responsiveness and seriousness
- Gathers facts before making promises
- Prevents further escalation
- Shows operational rigor (data-driven)

#### ACTION 2: Root Cause Analysis (Hours 2-6)

# SLIDE 8: CASE STUDY 3 - EXPRESS FULFILLMENT PROCESS MAP

## 2-Hour Turnaround Service Workflow

### Phase 1: Order Receipt & Validation (0-5 minutes)
1. Order received via API, auto-flagged as EXPRESS
2. Inventory system validates all items available
3. If unavailable → Auto-alert client with alternatives
4. If available → Proceed to priority queue

### Phase 2: Priority Queue Insertion (5-10 minutes)
1. Express orders jump to FRONT of picking queue
2. Alert sent to warehouse floor
3. Assign to EXPRESS-certified picker (trained staff only)

### Phase 3: Picking Process (10-45 minutes)
1. Picker receives order on handheld with EXPRESS flag
2. Pick items from shelves with barcode scanning
3. Real-time verification on each scan
4. Place in EXPRESS tote (red bins for visibility)

### Phase 4: Quality Check & Packing (45-75 minutes)
1. Mandatory QC at dedicated EXPRESS station
2. Verify: item count, accuracy, condition
3. If fails → Alert picker, re-pick, log error
4. Pack in branded EXPRESS packaging with protection
5. Generate shipping label, update status, photo documentation

### Phase 5: Staging & Handoff (75-105 minutes)
1. Move to EXPRESS staging area (separate from standard orders)
2. Priority courier called OR dedicated driver pickup
3. Scan out of warehouse
4. Client notification sent with tracking link

### Phase 6: Shipment (105-120 minutes)
1. Package in transit with real-time GPS tracking
2. Photo proof of delivery
3. Client satisfaction SMS confirmation

# SLIDE 9: CASE STUDY 3 (CONTINUED) - RISK ANALYSIS

## 🚨 KEY RISK: Dual-Speed Operations Create Systemic Disruption

### The Risk
Operating two parallel fulfillment tracks (standard vs express) in the same warehouse creates inherent conflicts that could degrade BOTH services.

### Specific Concerns

**1. Resource Cannibalization**
- Express orders constantly interrupt standard workflows
- Best staff pulled away from regular orders

**2. Standard Order Degradation**
- Regular customers experience worse service as deprioritized
- Risk alienating existing client base

**3. Complexity Overhead**
- Staff managing two separate processes = higher cognitive load
- Increased error probability

**4. Capacity Strain**
- Q1 data shows we're already struggling with quality
- Adding complexity when foundation is unstable = high risk

**5. Quality vs. Speed Tension**
- 2-hour SLA pressure may drive shortcuts
- Could increase error rates across all orders

### Evidence from Current State
- Already seeing 10% error rates on complex orders
- Staff absenteeism up 157% - workforce strained
- Processing times increasing - not handling current complexity well

### Required Mitigations
✓ Dedicated Express-only staff and physical space (separate workflows)
✓ Strict volume caps until proven stable
✓ Enhanced training program before launch
✓ Real-time monitoring dashboard to catch degradation early

# SLIDE 10: CASE STUDY 3 (CONTINUED) - OPPORTUNITY ANALYSIS

## 🎯 KEY OPPORTUNITY: Premium Pricing Funds Systemic Improvements

### The Opportunity
Express Fulfillment isn't just a new service - it's a revenue engine that can fund the operational improvements we desperately need.

### Specific Benefits

**1. Premium Margin Justification**
- 2-hour SLA commands 50-100% pricing premium vs standard
- Higher willingness to pay from time-sensitive clients

**2. Investment Capital**
- Margins fund technology upgrades (picking systems, automation)
- Improvements benefit ALL orders, not just Express

**3. Talent Development**
- Express-certified pickers create career ladder
- Reduces turnover and absenteeism issues
- Staff motivation from skill differentiation

**4. Process Innovation**
- Building optimized Express workflow forces documentation
- Process improvements can be backported to standard service
- Operational discipline (tracking, QC) raises all standards

**5. Competitive Differentiation**
- Creates moat against competitors
- Attracts high-value clients focused on reliability vs price
- Premium client base less sensitive to price increases

### Strategic Value

**Revenue Model Example:**
- Standard fulfillment fee: $5/order
- Express fulfillment fee: $10-12/order
- Assumption: 10% of orders convert to Express
- At 16,300 orders/month: 1,630 Express orders
- **Additional monthly revenue: $8,000-11,000**
- **Annual additional revenue: $96,000-132,000**

**Investment Use Cases:**
- Fund picking technology for large orders
- Hire additional trained staff (replace overtime)
- Implement training programs
- Upgrade inventory management systems

### Bottom Line
Express service is both a risk AND the solution - IF we execute correctly with dedicated resources and reinvest premium revenue into operational excellence.
